### Y2 2018 Summer: Basic Flask Lab

Welcome to the Python review lab! Please read all the instructions so you don't
get lost halfway through, but definitely feel free to ask for help if you
get stuck. Good luck, and have fun!

Throughout this lab, you should be editing app.py.

### PART 1

Edit the `home_page` function,, using just Python, to print your favorite sport. A stub for this function can be found in
app.py. Make sure you run `python app.py` to see your 
favorite sport printed.

### PART 2

Add your first HTML template inside the `templates` directory. Now, print your favorite sport as a heading, and
write a paragraph about why it's clearly the best sport.

### PART 3

Now, add a for loop into your template, to print a list
of your favorite players. This list should be defined
inside your Python `home_page` function.

### PART 4

After doing this, you realize that your website only caters to
those who like the same sport as you. So, use an if-statement, to check if a variable `likes_same_sport`, which
should be defined in your Python file, is True. If it is,
render the website, as before. If it's not, just print the paragraph explaining why you think that it's the best sport.

### PART 5

Create a new file `style.css` in the directory. Do you remember where this file goes? Import this file in your HTML template and use it to make the heading of your website red.

### PART 6

Make your website prettier - this can include
finding more complex templates online, or adding some more CSS
tricks of your own!
